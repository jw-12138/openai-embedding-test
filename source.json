These embeddings can then be used to find the most similar messages to the current message, and use those messages to generate a response.\n\nThere are also pre-trained language models like GPT-3 that can generate responses based on a given prompt or context, which can be used to generate responses based on the chat history embeddings.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this approach may not always produce the most accurate or relevant responses, as it relies heavily on the quality of the embeddings and similarity metrics used.
